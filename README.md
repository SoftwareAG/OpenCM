# OpenCM
OpenCM is a Configuration Management Repository for webMethods components and is primarily an operational/runtime governance tool of DBP wM components. It can act as a "source of truth" (documentation repo) and provides the ability to audit &amp; compare configuration property information in order to detect discrepancies. In addition, it is also used as an operations utility for quick and easy retrieval of property information through its user interface.
