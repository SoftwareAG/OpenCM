  <h4>Background</h4>
   <hr/>
		<p>OpenCM was developed during 2017 to support governance and control over installed and configured webMethods components. The properties of a DBP environment should be documented in some way which would then be a pre-requisites for providing not only an off-line reference but also to provide a single source of truth. Knowing <i>what</i> is configured can be deduced by the runtime environment but that may not always be the correct configuration. OpenCM provides the ability to capture runtime information (configurations) and automatic baselining of those properties (i.e. promoting runtime configurations to the source of truth).
		<br/><br/>
		Once configuration information has been captured (extracted) from runtime environments, it is then possible to perform automatic audits to verify its correctness. Both extraction and auditing can then be a scheduled activity to provide a constant, up to date, view of the runtime properties and its relation to the source of truth.
